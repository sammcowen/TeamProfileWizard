  ## Usage 
  Instructions for use:

  User will run the command 'node index.js' at the command line. Then the user will be prompted to answer questions about their manager of the team. Next the user will be presented with a menu. The menu will display options to either'Add Engineer, Add Intern or Finish Building Team.' Once the  user has added all team member information and selects 'Finsih Building My Team', the user will have an index.html document generated in the dist/ folder.
